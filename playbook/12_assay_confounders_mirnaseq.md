# miRNA-seq Confounders

miRNA profiles reflect **cell state and stress** more than pathway regulation.

---

## Major Confounders

### Global miRNA Shifts
Stress, hypoxia, or differentiation change many miRNAs

### Passenger miRNAs
Not all miRNAs are functional

### Tissue Composition
Different cell types have different miRNA repertoires

---

## Interpretation Rules

- Enriched targets ≠ active regulation
- Require reciprocal mRNA changes
- Look for validated miRNA-target pairs

---

## Validation

- miRNA mimics / inhibitors
- Target mRNA + protein measurement
- Reporter assays
